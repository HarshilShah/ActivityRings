    /// The ratio represented the proportion of the second value (i.e. `to`).
    /// So a ratio of `0` would return the starting `from` value, a ratio of `1`
    /// would return the final `to` value, and so on.

    ///   - firstValue: The starting value for the interpolation. This is the
    ///     value returned when the `ratio` is 0

    ///     value returned when the `ratio` is 1
    ///   - ratio: The proportion of the interpolation
